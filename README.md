# AI-Hobbyist (Part A)

Many people see problems in the world but struggle to articulate them in a clear way that can help create solutions. They donâ€™t know how to turn their thoughts into useful ideas. Using AI to solve these problems is also hard because of messy data and the need for technical skills. AI-Hobbyist helps users articulate their ideas by using stories, news, and PDFs to create problem statements. It also cleans messy data by fixing errors and missing values. With a simple, no-code approach, users can train AI models, check results, and download them, making AI easy to use for real-world impact.

The workflow consists of the following steps:
* **Input Sources**: Users provide input in the form of **problem stories, news articles, or PDFs**.
* **Preprocessing & Feature Extraction**: The system utilizes **NLTK and Simple RAG** to analyze text and generate a **word cloud** for key insights.
* **Problem Statement Generation**: **Natural Language Generation** techniques and **Meta LLaMA 3** refine and generate structured problem statements for dataset creation.
* **Dataset Preparation**: The uncleaned dataset undergoes **automated cleaning** to ensure quality and consistency.
* **Model Training & Optimization**: Users train machine learning models using a **low-code/no-code approach**, and results are evaluated for further optimization.

## Use Cases
AI-Hobbyist can be applied in various domains, including:
- **Sustainability & Climate Research**: Identifying pressing environmental issues from news and reports to generate structured datasets.
- **Social Impact Projects**: Helping NGOs and researchers define problems and prepare clean datasets for AI-driven solutions.
- **AI Research & Experimentation**: Allowing hobbyists, students, and developers to explore machine learning without deep technical knowledge.
- **Education & Learning**: Providing students a hands-on way to learn about AI problem formulation, data preprocessing, and model training.
